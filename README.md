# orderly

Single file, no pushing. Type-safe middleware that brings a little bit of order to Cloudflare Queues.

orderly removes the two failure modes every raw queue consumer carries: messages that are never
decided, and one bad message crashing a whole batch. Every message resolves to exactly one explicit
outcome, every outcome is recorded as an event, and the consumer never rejects. Zero runtime
dependencies.

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add @observerly/orderly
```

```sh
npm install @observerly/orderly
```

```sh
nub add @observerly/orderly
```

```sh
bun add @observerly/orderly
```

## Quick Start

Declare the payload once, and derive both ends from it:

```ts
// contracts/emails.ts
import { defineQueue } from '@observerly/orderly';

import { z } from 'zod';

const payload = z.object({
  userId: z.string(),
  kind: z.enum(['welcome', 'digest', 'receipt']),
});

export type EmailPayload = z.infer<typeof payload>;

// Any Standard Schema library plugs in: zod, valibot, arktype, or a plain function that throws.
export const emails = defineQueue<EmailPayload>({ name: 'emails', schema: payload });
```

```ts
// worker.ts
import { withExponentialRetryBackoff } from '@observerly/orderly';

import { emails } from './contracts/emails';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const producer = emails.producer(env.EMAILS);

    await producer.send({ userId: '42', kind: 'welcome' });

    await producer.send({ userId: '42', kind: 'digest' }, { delaySeconds: 3_600 });

    return new Response('enqueued', { status: 202 });
  },

  queue: emails.consumer({
    retry: withExponentialRetryBackoff({
      initialDelaySeconds: 5,
      factor: 2,
      maximumDelaySeconds: 600,
      jitter: 'full',
      limit: 6,
    }),

    async handle(message, context) {
      // message is a parsed EmailPayload: validated before this ran.
      // Return settles the message as succeeded; throw and the retry policy decides.
    },
  }),
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Cloudflare.Env>;
```

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  "queues": {
    "producers": [{ "binding": "EMAILS", "queue": "emails" }],
    "consumers": [{ "queue": "emails", "max_batch_size": 25, "max_retries": 10 }],
  },
}
```

No `ack()`, no `retry()`, no batch bookkeeping, no try/catch ceremony. The handler returns or
throws, the policy decides, the events record it, and a malformed body never reaches your code.

## The Settlement Model

Every message a consumer receives resolves to exactly one of four terminal outcomes, always
explicitly:

- **succeeded** — the handler returned. Acknowledged.
- **retried** — the handler threw and the retry policy scheduled a redelivery, with the delay it
  decided.
- **discarded** — the handler threw and the policy chose to stop. Acknowledged deliberately, with
  the reason recorded. A discard never reaches the dead letter queue: that catches only messages
  which exhausted the platform's own `max_retries`.
- **rejected** — the body failed validation and never reached the handler at all.

The word ack appears nowhere in orderly's vocabulary: succeeded and discarded both acknowledge at
the transport while meaning opposite things, and that distinction living in the events rather than
the transport is the point.

The consumer itself never rejects, because a rejected queue handler makes the platform retry the
whole batch, acknowledged messages included. One message failing, one middleware throwing, or one
observer exploding never touches a sibling's settlement.

## Retry Policies

A policy is a pure function from what happened to what to do about it:

```ts
import {
  withExponentialRetryBackoff,
  withFixedRetryBackoff,
  withImmediateRetry,
  withoutRetry,
} from '@observerly/orderly';

withExponentialRetryBackoff({
  initialDelaySeconds: 1,
  factor: 2,
  maximumDelaySeconds: 300,
  jitter: 'full',
  limit: 8,
});
withFixedRetryBackoff({ delaySeconds: 30, limit: 5 });
withImmediateRetry({ limit: 3 });
withoutRetry();
```

Or write your own — delays are floored and clamped into the platform bounds for you, and a policy
that itself throws discards rather than crashing the batch:

```ts
import type { RetryPolicy } from '@observerly/orderly';

const policy: RetryPolicy = ({ attempts, error }) =>
  attempts >= 5
    ? { action: 'discard', reason: 'exhausted' }
    : { action: 'retry', delaySeconds: 2 ** attempts };
```

## Middleware

One layer around one message, outermost first. A middleware sees the parsed body and the delivery
facts, awaits the outcome the layers inside it produced, and may pass it through or substitute it:

```ts
import type { Middleware } from '@observerly/orderly';

const timing = (): Middleware => async (message, context, next) => {
  const startedAt = Date.now();

  const outcome = await next();

  console.log(`${context.id} settled as ${outcome.type} in ${Date.now() - startedAt}ms`);

  return outcome;
};
```

## Validation

The `schema` option accepts any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) or a plain parse
function. A failing body settles as rejected before the middleware or the handler ever see it, and
`onRejected` decides what a rejection becomes:

```ts
emails.consumer({
  retry: withoutRetry(),
  handle: deliver,
  // Absent: rejections are acknowledged as their own terminal. Or convert them:
  onRejected: () => ({ action: 'retry', delaySeconds: 60 }),
});
```

## Observability

Every decision emits an event, and status is derived from the event log rather than stored:

```ts
import { statusOf, type Event } from '@observerly/orderly';

const events: Event[] = [];

emails.consumer({
  retry: withoutRetry(),
  handle: deliver,
  onEvent: event => events.push(event),
  onBatch: ({ queue, size, lagInMilliseconds, backlogCount, backlogBytes }) => {},
});

statusOf(events); // 'pending' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'
```

The vocabulary is closed: `batch.received`, `message.started`, then a terminal mirror of the
outcome for every message, with failures recorded as fact then decision.

## Schedules

A schedule is the vocabulary for when something should happen, and it reduces to one pure function:
`next(after)` returns the first occurrence strictly after the instant given, or `null` once nothing
will ever follow. Every constructor below produces one, every combinator takes and returns one, and
because the same instant in always yields the same instant out, every worker on every replay
computes the same series. The module depends on nothing but `Intl`.

```ts
import type { Schedule } from '@observerly/orderly';

const hourly: Schedule = { next: after => new Date(after.getTime() + 3_600_000) };
```

### Instants & Clock Cadences

The grammar reads as sentences, and an unfinished one does not compile: `at(date)` and `every(5)`
are not schedules until a verb finishes them.

```ts
import { at, every } from '@observerly/orderly';

const date = new Date('2026-01-05T09:00:00Z');

at(date).once(); // once, at exactly that instant, to the millisecond, then exhausted
at(date).every(5).minutes(); // that instant and every five minutes after it
at(date).every(1.5).hours(); // the clock units take fractional counts

every(5).minutes(); // :00, :05 and :10, aligned to the Unix epoch, not to when this ran
every(6).hours(); // 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 UTC
```

Alignment is the decision that keeps `next()` pure: `every(5).minutes()` ticks at the same instants
for everyone, so two deploys of one schedule can never drift apart. A cadence counted from an
instant of your choosing is `at(date).every(...)`, that instant being its first occurrence.

### Calendar Units

Days, weeks and months are calendar units rather than fixed spans, because a day is not always
twenty four hours and months differ in length. They land on a timezone's own calendar at a wall
clock time, UTC and midnight when neither is given:

```ts
import { every } from '@observerly/orderly';

every(1).days({ at: { hour: 9, minute: 0 }, timezone: 'Europe/London' });
every(2).weeks({ on: 'friday', at: { hour: 17, minute: 30 }, timezone: 'America/New_York' });
every(1).months({ on: 31 }); // a month without a thirty first is skipped, never clamped
```

### Cron

Cron is the five fields Cloudflare's own triggers read, with lists, ranges, steps, `JAN` through
`DEC` and `SUN` through `SAT`, and the days of the week counted from Sunday as one. When both day
fields are written, a day matches when either does, as classic cron has always read them:

```ts
import { cron, parseCron } from '@observerly/orderly';

cron('0 9 * * 2-6', { timezone: 'Europe/London' }); // weekdays at nine, London time
cron('30 2 1 * *'); // the first of every month at 02:30 UTC
cron('0 0 13 * FRI'); // every thirteenth and every Friday, not only Friday the thirteenth

parseCron('*/15 9-17 * * *'); // the fields expanded to the values they allow, as data
```

### Recurrence Rules

Recurrence rules are the grammar of RFC 5545, the one calendars speak. `FREQ`, `INTERVAL`, `COUNT`,
`UNTIL`, `BYMONTH`, `BYMONTHDAY`, `BYDAY`, `BYHOUR`, `BYMINUTE` and `WKST` are honoured, each part
narrowing or expanding exactly as the specification's table has it for its frequency. `from` plays
the role of `DTSTART`: the parts a rule leaves unwritten take their values from it, and it is the
first occurrence.

```ts
import { parseRecurrenceRule, recurrenceRule } from '@observerly/orderly';

const from = new Date('2026-01-05T09:00:00Z');

recurrenceRule('FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=2MO', { from, timezone: 'Europe/London' }); // second Mondays
recurrenceRule('FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=2;BYMONTHDAY=29', { from }); // every leap day
recurrenceRule('FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR;COUNT=10', { from }); // ten, the anchor the first
recurrenceRule('FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20261231T090000Z', { from }); // the end is inclusive

parseRecurrenceRule('FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=6'); // the parts expanded to what they name, as data
```

The parts not honoured, `BYSECOND`, `BYYEARDAY`, `BYWEEKNO` and `BYSETPOS`, are refused by name
rather than ignored, because a rule quietly stripped of what narrows it fires far more often than
it was asked to. Two choices are stricter than the specification: a counted weekday beside
`BYMONTHDAY` is refused, and the frequencies below a day step in instants, so an hourly rule stays
hourly across a daylight saving transition rather than repeating or skipping an hour of wall clock.

### Combining Schedules

```ts
import { between, cron, every, exclude, union } from '@observerly/orderly';

union([cron('0 9 * * 2-6'), cron('0 12 * * 1,7')]); // weekdays at nine and weekends at noon
exclude(cron('0 9 * * *'), cron('0 9 25 12 *')); // every morning except Christmas morning
between(every(1).hours(), { from: opens, until: closes }); // both ends inclusive, either open
```

`union` fires whenever any member does and exhausts only once every member has. `exclude` removes
the occurrences another schedule names, matched exactly to the millisecond, the way RFC 5545
removes exception dates from a recurrence set. `between` bounds a schedule to a window, firing
nothing before it opens and exhausting once it has closed.

### Time Zones & The Ends Of Time

Every constructor that reads a timezone uses the runtime's own IANA data through `Intl` and decides
daylight saving the same way: a wall time a spring forward gap swallows lands the gap's span later,
and a wall time a fall back repeats lands on its first occurrence. The end of the range a `Date`
can hold is exhaustion, never an error, and an invalid `Date` is refused loudly, at construction or
on `next()`, never read as exhaustion.

### Previewing & Date Arithmetic

To see what a schedule will do, walk it:

```ts
import { add, preview, subtract } from '@observerly/orderly';

preview(schedule, { after: new Date(), take: 5 }); // the next five occurrences, as Dates

add(now, { hours: 1, minutes: 30 }); // a Duration: days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds
subtract(deadline, { days: 1 });
```

## Requirements

orderly runs on [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) and is tested inside it. It ships
as ESM with TypeScript declarations, requires nothing at runtime, and follows Standard Schema
rather than depending on any validation library.

## Contributing

orderly runs on workerd rather than Node, which shapes how it is built and tested. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get set up.

## Releasing

Changes that consumers would notice need a changeset, and releases happen by pushing a version tag.
See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
